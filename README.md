BayesSplit

This is code for handling SKS phases under difficult conditions: low signal to noise ratios, a small number of events, and complex anisotorpy. 

Complex anisotropy in this case means either multiple layers or layers within which the fast-direction is not constant. 

This project is currently active. In the mean time, feel free to download and contact me if you have any questions, but there won't be docucmentation for use until publication (which is underway).
