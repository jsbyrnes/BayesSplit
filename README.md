BayesSplit

This is code for handling SKS phases under difficult conditions: low signal to noise ratios, a small number of events, and complex anisotorpy. 

Complex anisotropy in this case means either multiple layers or layers within which the fast-direction is not constant. 

This is for a project currently awaiting a funding decision, and will be reactivated if funding becomes available. In the mean time, feel free to download and contact me if you have any questions.
